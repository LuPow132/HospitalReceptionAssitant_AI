AI: ChatCompletionMessage(content='Your height is 178 cm and your weight is 68 kg. To evaluate whether your weight is within a healthy range, we can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI).\n\nThe BMI is calculated using the formula:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight in kg}}{(\\text{height in m})^2} \\]\n\nIn your case:\n- Height in meters = 178 cm = 1.78 m\n- Weight = 68 kg\n\nCalculating your BMI:\n\\[ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{68}{(1.78)^2} \\approx 21.5 \\]\n\nA BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy.
